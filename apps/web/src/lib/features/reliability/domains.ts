// domains.ts — the SINGLE structural home for every fixed, absolute chart domain the lines
// reliability surface scales against. A magnitude mark NEVER computes its own scale inline; it
// reads a constant here, so the same value renders the same length on every route / grain / 30s
// refresh (the audit's law #1) and like metrics share like scales. The domains are LITERALS —
// never `Math.max(...inView)`, never `/max`, never in-view normalization (the chart-doctrine
// law). Grouped by UNIT; each is zero-anchored (or signed-zero) and justified inline.

// ── Percentages (a share of a whole) — ALWAYS the full [0,100] scale ────────────────────────
// A percentage is a fraction of a whole, so its honest domain IS the whole: [0,100]. A 7% share
// fills 7% of the bar, never an exaggerated slice of a zoomed max — so a near-empty bar
// truthfully reads "this is rare", and the precise value (plus any "X of Y" count) carries the
// detail. ALL share the scale, so on-time / severe / bunched / cancellation / skipped are
// directly comparable and none can visually overstate itself.

// ── Delay / time (minutes) — metric-specific honest ranges ──────────────────────────────────
// Delays genuinely cluster in small minute ranges, and each constant measures a DIFFERENT
// thing, so each carries the range that keeps its real signal visible without clipping. (These

// delay-trend retard axis reads DELAY_DIST_DOMAIN [0,15] because it can plot the p90 tail (the
// "slowest 10%" toggle), which routinely runs past 8 min — [0,8] would clip that tail. Both are
// zero-anchored absolute literals (never in-view max); the [0,8] vs [0,15] split is a RECORDED
// exception to "like metrics share like scales", justified by avg-only vs p90-capable ranges.
// Unifying the two trend axes is S9 scope (the network re-seat owns it); until then this
// divergence is a decision, not drift, and lines' [0,8] domain stays put.
